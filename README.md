Welcome to the practice repository! 

## Setting up Github  :^)

If you don't already have one, Set up an account on <https://github.com>. Save your new account in your favorite password manager. If you don't have a password manager, consider getting one: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager>

## How to Start the Practice Exercise

1. Go to <https://github.com/jmf-nyu/miap_diglit> and fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the browser window. This will create a copy of the repository in your own account.

2. You should be taken to the fork of your repository

3. Create a new branch with your first name as the name of the branch

5. Always sync your branch with the upstream repository and merge new changes before starting any new work.

6. See [the command line guide to get get an idea of what you're working on](/docs/index.md). Use the entry for [ls](/docs/ls.md) as a template for your new command line page. You were assigned a command in class.

7. Make sure you are in the new branch of your fork. Create a new markdown file titled `[command you want to write about].md`. Make sure that this is in the `docs` folder.
8. Hack away on your local computer! Add some text, images, URLs, code snippets to the .md file to describing your command in BASH.
9. Save your new .md file.
10. Commit your changes.
12. Submit a pull request.

## Checking the Results

1. Check to make sure the pull request is approved. If it is not approved, you may need to make changes. Make your pull request a draft. Make the changes on your fork. Then resubmit the pull request.

## Uploading Images
To upload an image, you can add a file to the docs folder instead of simply dragging the photo to your md page.
