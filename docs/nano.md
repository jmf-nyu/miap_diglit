# The Nano Command

## Summary 
Nano is a simple terminal-based text editor. Though not as powerful as Emacs or Vim, it is easy to learn and use. Nano is ideal for making small changes to existing configuration files or for writing short plain text files. It was originally created as a free replacement for the non-free Pico editor. 

## How to use it 
To start nano with an empty file, open a terminal window and at the command-line type "nano" (without the quotes) 
To open an existing file for editing, type "nano filename" where filename is the name of the existing file. For example, to open the file that contains the list of most recently issued commands, make sure you are in your home directory, and at the command line type "nano .bash_history" 


## Editing Text
As is normal in most text editors, text that you type into nano is inserted at the current cursor position. The Delete and Backspace keys also work the same as in other editors. Unlike elsewhere in command line, typing in nano works similar to typing in a regular document. 


## Quitting Nano
To quit nano, use the Ctrl+X key combination. If the file you are working on has been modified since the last time you saved it, you will be prompted to save the file first. Type y to save the file, or n to exit nano without saving the file.
