# The pwd Command

## Summary 
Command `pwd` stands for __print working directory__. It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called *working directory*.

## Basic command structure
For all descriptions below, the dollar sign indicates that BASH command prompt.

$ `pwd`

When navigating files and directories in the terminal, `pwd` shows where you are in the filesystem.

## Output
The `ls` command has many different kinds of outputs as described below:
* **Standard output** with no flags, which displays the names of directories and files within the directory where the command is run:

## Examples 
* If you want to see hidden files in a nice list format run $ `ls -la ~`. The `~` would indicate your home folder.
* To get a the contents of an entire directory structure starting at a parent folder: $ `ls -alRt`. If you'd like, you can use a redirect, such as `>` to send the output to a text file. Here's an example: $ `ls -alRt ~/Desktop > ~/Desktop/report.txt`
