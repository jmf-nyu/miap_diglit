# The sudo Command

## Summary 
The `sudo` command allows users to run programs with the security priviledges of another user. When trusted users precede an administrative command with `sudo`, they are prompted for their password. Once authenticated and assuming the command is permitted, the administrative command is executed as if by the root user. 

## Basic command structure
The basis format of the `sudo` command is as follows. For the description below, the dollar sign indicates that BASH command prompt.

$ `sudo <command>`

Note: If the user tries to run this command without including `sudo` and does not have the necessary permissions, the host system will return a message stating that access is denied. By including `sudo`, the user can now retrieve and edit the file's contents at the privileged level.

## Possible Flags 
### `-p`
The `-p` flag uses a custom password prompt with optional escape sequences.

### `-u`
The `-u` flag is used when you want to run the command as a user other than the default target user (usually root). 

## Examples 
* If you want to get the lastest updates or upgrade your server, run $ `sudo apt update` and $ `sudo apt upgrade`.
* If you want to reboot your machine, run $ `sudo reboot`.
* To install software, run $ `sudo apt install <software>`.
